Here are some key insights:
Men Shoes dominate YTD sales with $940K (43% of revenue) — high performer but also a single-point risk.
Sales spike in Q4 (Sep & Dec), indicating strong seasonality — ideal for promotional focus.
Mobile & Accessories have highest reviews (6.4M) but lowest sales — highlighting a mismatch between engagement and revenue.
Over 80% of sales come from just 3 categories — scope to diversify and optimize other segments.
